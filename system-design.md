# System Design




### A. Decide on the Architecture
[ ] 

- **Identify the Architectural Pattern:** Choose between client-server, three-tier, microservices, etc., based on my application needs.
- **Determine the Technology Stack:** Select databases, frameworks, libraries that fit my requirements.
- **Sketch the High-level Architecture:** Create a diagram to represent the relationships between different parts of the system.

### B. Design the Database Schema
[ ]

- **Identify Entities:** Define all the main objects, such as profiles, requests, groups, and their attributes.
- **Determine Relationships:** Identify relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many between climbers and requests).
- **Normalize the Schema:** Organize data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.
- **Create ER Diagram:** An Entity-Relationship Diagram will help visualize the structure.

### C. Create Wireframes or Mockups
[ ]

- **Identify Key Interfaces:** Determine the main pages/screens my users will interact with.
- **Sketch Wireframes:** Create low-fidelity wireframes for each interface to layout content and functionality.
- **Build Mockups (Optional):** Higher-fidelity mockups or prototypes can be developed to get a feel for the user experience.
- **Consider User Flows:** Map out how users navigate through the application.

### D. Identify Third-party APIs
[ ]

- **List Potential Services:** Identify what external services are needed, like payment processing or email notifications.
- **Evaluate Options:** Research available APIs or providers to find ones that meet my requirements and budget.
- **Document Integration Points:** Detail how these services will be integrated into my system.

### E. Finalize Design Documents
[ ]

- **Compile All Design Elements:** Gather all diagrams, wireframes, and documents in a coherent design document.
- **Review and Revise:** Double-check everything for consistency and completeness. Adjust as needed.
- **Get Feedback If Possible:** If I can, have someone with experience review my designs, or even consult with potential users.

### F: Security and Scalability Considerations
[ ]

- **Identify Security Measures:** Plan for authentication, authorization, data encryption, etc.
- **Consider Scalability:** If BPC could grow significantly, design with future scaling in mind.
