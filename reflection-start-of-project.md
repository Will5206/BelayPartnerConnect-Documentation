# Reflection: Start of Project


The initial inspiration to pursue a project that showcased my back-end dev skills stemmed from my understanding that I needed to build trust with a potential employer.

After exploring the seemingly non-creative and boring bubble of "projects to showcase on your portfolio", from tic-tac-toe to a basic chat app, it was easy for me to see that in order to stand out more, I needed to be more creative. I also felt the need to create something that I was genuinely passionate about and that could solve a real-world problem.
