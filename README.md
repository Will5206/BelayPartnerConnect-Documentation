# BelayPartnerConnect-Documentation

This repo is going to be the home for all of my BPC planning. I am primarily using Obsidian to map out the project on a high level.

## Project Summary

Belay Partner Connect is a digital platform designed to connect climbers seeking partners for belaying or bouldering. Replacing the traditional method of bulletin boards in climbing gyms, this web service allows users to create profiles, detailing their skill level, availability, preferences, and even certifications like belaying individuals with visual impairments. Key features include profile verification through gym affiliations, an auto-match system based on metadata such as skill level, a dynamic message board for requests and confirmations, and the ability to create or join climbing groups. Offering both the convenience of online connectivity and community-building tools, Belay Partner Connect aims to enhance the climbing experience by making it easier to find compatible climbing partners and foster a stronger climbing community.
