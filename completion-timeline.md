# Completion Timeline



1. **Requirement Analysis:**

    - Define what the application should do.
    - Identify user roles and permissions.
    - List all the features in detail, including optional and mandatory ones.
    - Consider potential legal and ethical implications (such as certification for belaying visually impaired climbers).
    
1. **System Design:**

    - Decide on the architecture: client-server, three-tier, etc.
    - Design the database schema.
    - Create wire frames or mockups for the user interface.
    - Identify any third-party APIs or services I'll need (such as payment processing for b.m.a.c).
    
3. **Implementation:**

    - Break down the design into smaller, manageable tasks or sprints (usually 1-2 weeks long).
    - Write code, building features one at a time.
    - Write automated tests to ensure functionality.
    
1. **Testing:**

    - Test individual components (unit testing).
    - Test the whole system (integration testing).
    - Consider conducting usability testing with real users.
    
1. **Deployment:**

    - Set up hosting, domain name, SSL certificate.
    - Deploy the application to a live environment.
    - Monitor for errors and performance issues.
    
1. **Maintenance and Support:**

    - Continuously monitor and address bugs or issues.
    - Consider a feedback loop with users for future enhancements.





### Smaller Items

- **Create User Stories:** Define each feature as a user story that describes how a specific type of user interacts with the system.
    
- **Prioritize Features:** Use the MoSCoW method, categorizing features as Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Won't-have.
    
- **Version Control:** Use Git branches for developing individual features or sprints.
    
- **Database Migrations:** Structure the database changes in a way that allows versioning, enabling easy deployment or rollback.
    
- **Testing Framework:** Select a testing framework that fits my tech stack and write tests as I go.
    
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD to automate building, testing, and deploying code.
    
- **Legal Compliance:** For the visual impairment feature, consult with legal experts or stakeholders in the climbing community. Discuss w/ U.G in Denver, CO?
    
- **Feedback:** Implement a way for users to provide feedback and report issues.
